# GitPress Example

The objective here is to create example project for the ![Gitpress platform](https://github.com/pschoffer/gitpress).
Its very easy to install and you can try it easily home.

## Instalation
 - Unzip the package in an empty directory and upload everything;
 - Open `wp-admin/install.php` in your browser. It will take you through the process to set up a `wp-config.php` file with your database connection details;
    - If for some reason this doesn't work, don't worry. It doesn't work on all web browsers. Open up `wp-config-example.php` with a text editor like WordPad or similar and fill in your database connection details;
    - Save the file as `wp-config.php` and upload it;
    - Open ![wp-admin/install.php](wp-admin/install.php) in your browser;
- Once the configuration file is set up, the installer will set up the tables needed for your site. If there is an error, double check your `wp-config.php` file, and try again. If it fails again, please go to the ![WordPress support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/forums/) with as much data as you can gather;  
- **If you did not enter a password, note the password given to you** If you did not provide a username, it will be `admin`;
- The installer should then send you to the ![login page](wp-login.php). Sign in with the username and password you chose during the installation. If a password was generated for you, you can then click on `Profile` to change the password.

## Updating
### Using the Automatic Updater
If you are updating from version 2.7 or higher, you can use the automatic updater:

- Open ![wp-admin/update-core.php](wp-admin/update-core.php) in your browser and follow the instructions;
- You wanted more, perhaps? That's it!

### Updating Manually

- Before you update anything, make sure you have backup copies of any files you may have modified such as `index.php`;
- Delete your old WordPress files, saving ones you've modified;
- Upload the new files;
- Point your browser to ![wp-admin/upgrade.php](/wp-admin/upgrade.php).
